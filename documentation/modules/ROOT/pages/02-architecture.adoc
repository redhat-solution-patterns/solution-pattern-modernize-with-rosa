Introduction for the architecture of this solution pattern.

[#rosaarch]
== ROSA Architecture 
ROSA supports the following network configuration types:

- Public Network
- Private Network


[#rosaarchpublic]
== ROSA on public networks

We can install ROSA using either a public or private network. We can configure a private cluster and private network connection during or after the cluster creation process. Red Hat manages the cluster with limited access through a public network.

[#rosaarchprivatelink]
== ROSA on private networks with AWS PrivateLink

We can create a cluster using AWS PrivateLink, which is hosted on private subnets only. Red Hat managed infrastructure that creates AWS PrivateLink clusters is hosted on private subnets. The connection between Red Hat and the customer-provided infrastructure is created through AWS PrivateLink VPC endpoints.
